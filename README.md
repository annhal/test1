# test1

## First push and pull tests
- A line added via laptop
- A line added via git

## An introduction with recipes 
- https://github.com/dianaiusan/recipe-book
- The project description is in md.
- All titles reflect contents, and edits, and you can always go back to this specific version.
- Removed lines are red, added lines are green.

### Assignment on recipes
- Tally changes in guac recipe: go to it, history, 5 edits
- Which recipes have salt: use upper search field, determine word and repo, 5 recipes
- Knowing who did what: go to guac, blame
- Are you allowed to reuse the book: go to LICENSE in main folder
- Then, there was something with issues and pull requests which I haven't figured out

## Forking
- Check notes
- Creating a fork is creating a sort of branch of an extant repo (own copy).

## Creating repo's
- https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-r-project
- Create new repo, use template of UU, this is a repo in your personal space (test2_repo_create)
- There's a really nice slide differentiating the two
- You can make edits in your new repo
- AND COMMIT THEM
- AND THEN MAKE AVAILABLE LOCALLY by cloning: repo > code > copy ssh key
- check your directory in the terminal, I've made a mistake and placed test2 in test1
